### **Part III: Proof of Concept Code**

The provided `KM6_v6_RESEARCH_PACKAGE.py` script serves as a proof of concept for the engineering design process behind a component of the NEXUS-D. It is not the operational code for the aircraft's AI or systems.

**Purpose:** This script is a conceptual optimization framework. Its function is to find the ideal design parameters for an aerodynamic surface (like a wing or canard) by running simulations that balance two competing objectives: maximizing **aerodynamic performance** against a target and minimizing **manufacturability cost and complexity**. An engineer would use this tool in the earliest stages of design to arrive at a mathematically sound starting point before detailed CAD modeling and physical prototyping begin.
